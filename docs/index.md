# Welcome to the AI Agent Workshop!

This workshop provides a hands-on introduction to the concepts, patterns, and practical implementations of AI agents, using the `agentic-playground` repository as a basis.

Over the next three days, we will explore:

*   **Day 1: Foundations:** Basic LLM interaction, handling multimodal inputs (images), and working with complex data structures like knowledge graphs.
*   **Day 2: Single Agents & Orchestration:** Equipping agents with tools, implementing autonomous agents using the ReAct pattern, and incorporating human-in-the-loop workflows.
*   **Day 3: Advanced Multi-Agent Systems:** Designing systems where multiple specialized agents collaborate using structured workflows (LangGraph) and dynamic group chats (AutoGen/MagenticOne).

Please use the navigation menu to access the content for each day, including module explanations, hands-on exercises, and solutions.

Let's begin exploring the exciting world of AI agents!
